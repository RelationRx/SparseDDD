# SparseDDD

This repository is the official implementation of [Sparse Dynamic Distribution Decomposition: Efficient Integration of Trajectory and SnapshotTime Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05138). 

## Requirements


Files run on 2019b version of Matlab, Octave does not have some of the statistical commands used. 
Requirements:
- Symbolic Math Toolbox (for dynamical system in /data only)
- Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox.
- Optimisation toolbox.


## Evaluation

To evaluate the package, run the Package_RunMe_Comparison file. 

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

> ðŸ“‹Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

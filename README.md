Implementation of Sparse Dynamic Distribution Decomposition
=======

This repository is the official implementation of [Sparse Dynamic Distribution Decomposition: Efficient Integration of Trajectory and SnapshotTime Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05138). 


## Requirements


Files run on 2019b version of Matlab, Octave does not have some of the statistical commands used. 
Requirements:
- Symbolic Math Toolbox (for dynamical system in /data only)
- Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox.
- Optimisation toolbox.


## Evaluation


To evaluate the package, run the Package_RunMe_Comparison file in the matlab folder.
